## Generative Book Covers

This document compiles examples of large-run printed books with generative cover designs. For the purposes of this repository, "generative" means each copy is unique, and "large run" means this document does not consider print-on-demand.

The purpose of this page is to help you convince your reluctant publisher that *Yes, This Is Possible, It's Really Cool, And It's Not That Difficult.*

These materials were originally presented in a Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/golan/status/1282703748188590082). Thanks to everyone who contributed links.
